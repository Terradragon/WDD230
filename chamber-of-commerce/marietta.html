            <h2>Breif Historical Events</h2>
            <p>Reported in 1824, Marietta, Georgia started as a small cluster of homes nested near the Cherokee Town of Kennesaw. The state of Georgia was legally recognized ten years later. The city gained some damage during the Civil War when 22 Union agents when they boarded the W & A Railroad train that was set northbound at the Marietta Station. After that, they took over the train until they were later caught by "Andrew Raiders" that ended up being a famous locomotive chase. Following battles during the war were taken around Kennesaw Mountain â€“ which is now a historical site and a hiking trail.<br>
            The recovery after the war was slow for the city, but it eventally began to prosper as new businesses moved in. Finances began to improve, but the burned courthouse left a scar on the city until a new building was constructed in 1872.</p>
